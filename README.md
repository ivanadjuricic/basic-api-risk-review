# Basic API Review – Learning Project

This is a small learning project where I reviewed a public REST API to
understand how data is returned and how API behavior can affect systems.

The focus of this project is not security testing or hacking, but learning
how APIs behave, what data they expose, and how this can matter in real systems.

## What I looked at
- What endpoints return
- How much data is returned
- How responses are structured
- How errors are shown

## What I learned
- APIs can return more data than is actually needed
- Clear structure and consistency in responses is important
- Reviewing data flow helps understand potential risks and system behavior

## Tools
- Python
- Public REST API
